We would love it if you stayed with us at Robert H. Treman State Park.

You can make a reservation through the "Camping Reservation" tab on the left of the page: <a class="page-link" href="http://parks.ny.gov/parks/135/details.aspx">http://parks.ny.gov/parks/135/details.aspx</a>  
We will be staying at site #46. We recommend staying close to us (why are you here in the first place?) because we are near the toilets/showers.

We will shuttle you to and from the airport as well as to and from the wedding and reception. Campers will also get dinner on Friday and brunch on Saturday. So camp with us. It'll be, like, all inclusive.

You can have up to six people, two tents, and two cars per campsite, so we encourage you to share. If you need help finding camping partners, or if you want to camp but don't have equipment, let us know in your RSVP and we can sort something out.  

There are also camper cabins available if you're into a more nouveau-chic camping experience.
