We would love it if you stayed with us at Robert H. Treman State Park.

You can make a reservation through the "Camping Reservation" tab on the left of the page: <a class="page-link" href="http://parks.ny.gov/parks/135/details.aspx">http://parks.ny.gov/parks/135/details.aspx</a>  
We will be staying at site #46. We recommend staying close to us (why are you here in the first place?) because we are near the toilets/showers.

We will shuttle you to and from the airport as well as to and from the wedding and reception. Campers will also get dinner on Friday and brunch on Saturday. So camp with us. It'll be, like, all inclusive.

If you have a tent, please bring it. For those without tents, mention in your RSVP that you will be requiring assistance to camp, and we'll figure it out.

There are also camper cabins available if you're into a more noveau-chic camping experience.
