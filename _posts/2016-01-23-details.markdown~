A reception will immediately follow the ceremony. Dinner, drinks and hors d'oeuvres will be served, though not necessarily in that order. Please indicate any dietary restrictions in your RSVP.  

What should you wear? Well, the real answer is that you should wear whatever makes you happy and comfortable and we will be delighted to see you! But if you're looking to fit in formality-wise, you might aim for something you'd wear to a semi-casual garden party: sundresses, cocktail dresses, summer suiting, khakis and a blazer, etc.  

Also, the ceremony will be outside, so you may want to wear flats or chunky heels, and you might appreciate a light sweater.

A shuttle will bring people from the hotel and campsite to Newhart's Lodge. We will update the accomodations page with information on departure times. Two return shuttles, one early bird and one night owl, will be available.  

There is plenty of parking on site.
