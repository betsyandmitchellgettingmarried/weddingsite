A reception will immediately follow the ceremony. Dinner, drinks and hors d'oeuvres will be served, though not necessarily in that order. Please indicate any dietary restrictions in your RSVP.  

The ceremony will be outside. You may want to choose flats or chunky heels, and you might appreciate a light sweater.  

A shuttle will bring people from the hotel and campsite to Newhart's Lodge. We will update the accomodations page with information on departure times. Two return shuttles, one early bird and one night owl, will be available.
