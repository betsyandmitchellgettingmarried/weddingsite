The Ithaca airport (ITH): Gateway to the bustling hub of economic activity that is Upstate New York.  
If you fly into Ithaca, send us your travel your itinerary. We will arrange a shuttle to and from the hotel/campsite.  

Other viable airports include Syracuse (SYR) and Elmira/Corning (ELM). You are on your own shuttling from these.
