Wow! If you're on this page, it means we haven't tired you out yet. Kudos!

Here is our list of Ithaca coffee places to try in order from most snooty/la-dee-da to most friendly/at-home-wrapped-in-a-warm-blanket:

<ol>
	<li>Press Cafe</li>
	<li>Carriage House Cafe</li>
	<li>Gimme! Coffee</li>
	<li>Collegetown Bagels</li>
	<li>Hal's Deli</li>
</ol>

We might try to have a tour of the Cornell campus on Saturday. TBD. Check back later.

Ithaca has a lovely <a class="page-link" href="http://www.ithacamarket.com/">farmer's market</a>. 
Steamboat Landing. 545 3rd St. Ithaca, NY 14850.

Gorges. Ithaca is them. You can visit one of the many close and lovely state parks: Robert H. Treman, Buttermilk, or Taughannock. Or walk through downtown to Cascadilla Creek Falls or Ithaca Falls. They are all worth it.  	

Wineries. Google them yourself.

If you've made it this far, you've won. Good job.
